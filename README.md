UofR School of Nursing Code Challenge

The file SON Analyst Programmer Technical Quiz dotNET 2023.pdf contains the code challenge instructions.
Note: It appears that the instructions on page 5, under the heading
"Using AdventureWorks2016 database create scripts for the following scenarios", is incomplete. Info on salespersons,
product info, etc., needed to complete the scenarios in steps 1 through 4 is missing. I've ignored this page.

The Meliora directory contains the solution for item #2 Meliora.sln

The file SQL.pdf contains the solution for item #5 SQL Query
