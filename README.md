UofR School of Nursing Code Challenge

The file SON Analyst Programmer Technical Quiz dotNET 2023.pdf contains the code challenge instructions.
Note: It appears that the instructions on page 5, under the heading
"Using AdventureWorks2016 database create scripts for the following scenarios", is incomplete. Info on salespersons,
product info, etc., needed to complete the scenarios in steps 1 through 4 is missing. I've ignored this page and will
revisit it if I have time before the deadline.

The Meliora directory contains the solution for item #2 Meliora.sln. The SimpleCounter project implements a simple
console application per instructions. SimpleCounterUI runs SimpleCounter and presents the output in a GUI rather
than to a console window. MelioraWebApp implements a counter UI as a self contained web application.

Note: After building solution, copy the contents of the SimpleCounter build target directory to the SimpleCounterUI
build target directory, since SimpleCounterUI is expecting SimpleCounter in this location.

The BusinessLayerLibrary directory contains the solution for item #3 Business Layer and the start of item #4 Report
Page. The BusinessLayerLibrary project contains the code for item #3. The ReportPage directory contains the code for
item #4. I didn't get very far with #4. First of all, I didn't have the right Visual Studio components installed for
ASP.Net Web App (.Net Framework) installed. It took a bit of searching to find which module to install, and after a
few hours, I finally had that figured out. I created the ReportPage project using the ASP.Net Web App (.Net Framework)
template, but was unable to run it due to "This site canâ€™t be reachedlocalhost refused to connect." error. I spent
quite a bit of time trying to figure this out but as of 11:30 pm Thursday night, I decided to call it quits. I'm
sure I could figure this out but with the 9am deadline looming, I figured I've given it my best shot in the given
timeframe.
