UofR School of Nursing Code Challenge

The file SON Analyst Programmer Technical Quiz dotNET 2023.pdf contains the code challenge instructions.
Note: It appears that the instructions on page 5, under the heading
"Using AdventureWorks2016 database create scripts for the following scenarios", is incomplete. Info on salespersons,
product info, etc., needed to complete the scenarios in steps 1 through 4 is missing. I've ignored this page and will
revisit it if I have time before the deadline.

The Meliora directory contains the solution for item #2 Meliora.sln. The SimpleCounter project implements a simple
console application per instructions. SimpleCounterUI runs SimpleCounter and presents the output in a GUI rather
than to a console window. MelioraWebApp implements a counter UI as a self contained web application.

Note: After building solution, copy the contents of the SimpleCounter build target directory to the SimpleCounterUI
build target directory, since SimpleCounterUI is expecting SimpleCounter in this location.

The file SQL.pdf contains the solution for item #5 SQL Query

The file VersionControl.pdf contains the solution for item #6 Version Control
